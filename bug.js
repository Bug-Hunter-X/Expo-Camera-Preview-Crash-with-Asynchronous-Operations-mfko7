This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API in conjunction with other asynchronous operations.  The issue is that the camera preview might not render correctly or might crash if a promise from another operation (e.g., fetching data from an API) resolves after the camera component has unmounted. This leads to a race condition where the camera tries to update itself with data intended for a component that no longer exists.  This can manifest as a blank screen, a frozen preview, or even an app crash.
